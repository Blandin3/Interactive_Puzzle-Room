# Puzzle Room - Interactive Environment Challenge

## 🎮 Game Concept

A first-person puzzle game where players are trapped in a locked room and must solve 5 sequential puzzles to escape. Each completed puzzle reveals a cryptic clue for the next challenge. The room progressively dims as puzzles are solved, creating an immersive atmosphere. Players must use observation, logic, and timing to unlock the door and escape.
